## Routing Scenarios
### Traffic routed between pods on the same node

### Traffic routed between pods on different nodes

### Traffic routed between a pod and a Virtual machine in the same virtual network (VM on a different subnet). 2-way flows

### Traffic routed between a pod and an external URL/IP address (e.g. Container Registry)

### Traffic sent from a pod to a service fronting a bunch of pods (e.g. traffic from an app layer pod sent to the service fronting DB pods)

### Traffic sent from an external client to a pod through a service (Node port)
