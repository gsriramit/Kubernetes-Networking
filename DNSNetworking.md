## DNS Resolution from the context of worker pods
### Concepts
1. Kubernetes publishes information about Pods and Services which is used to program DNS. Kubelet configures Pods' DNS so that running containers can lookup Services by name rather than IP
2. Services defined in the cluster are assigned DNS names. By default, a client Pod's DNS search list includes the Pod's own namespace and the cluster's default domain
3. With only CoreDNS's Kubernetes plugin specified, the plugin will default to the zone specified in the serverâ€™s block. It will handle all queries in that zone and connect to Kubernetes in-cluster (ref: https://coredns.io/plugins/kubernetes/). By default, the zone specified in the server block would be **cluster.local**
```
kubernetes [ZONES...] {
    endpoint URL
    tls CERT KEY CACERT
    kubeconfig KUBECONFIG [CONTEXT]
    namespaces NAMESPACE...
    labels EXPRESSION
    pods POD-MODE
    endpoint_pod_names
    ttl TTL
    noendpoints
    fallthrough [ZONES...]
    ignore empty_service
}
```
4. When CoreDNS starts with the kubernetes plugin enabled, it connects to the Kubernetes API and synchronize all object watches.
   - By default the kubernetes plugin watches Endpoints via the *discovery.EndpointSlices* API. However the *api.Endpoints* API is used instead if the Kubernetes version does not support the EndpointSliceProxying feature gate by default (i.e. Kubernetes version < 1.19).
5. CoreDNS provides mechanisms to extend the DNS resolution process through the forward plugin (ref: https://coredns.io/plugins/kubernetes/#stubdomains-and-upstreamnameservers)
   - When the custom domains and the corresponding forward lookup servers are specified, CoreDNS forwards the lookup requests to those custom DNS servers through the network connectivity established from the host.
```
cluster.local:53 {
    kubernetes cluster.local
}
example.local {
    forward . 10.100.0.10:53
}

. {
    forward . 8.8.8.8:53
}
```
6. Pods that use the "Default" DNS policy would be using the DNS configuration of the underlying node on which the pods are scheduled. So, name resolution requests for external public domains such as Microsoft.com and Azure specific domains such as <sitename>.azurewebsites.net would be sent to Azure DNS (i.e. 168.63.129.16)
